This software allows the user to inpaint an image using multiple techniques.

Currently, FastDigitalInpainting is implemented, but seems to display strange behavior in that the inpainted region looks correct after a few iterations, but then gets darker and darker as further iterations are carried out. If anyone can see the problem, please let me know!

Please note that  BertalmioInpainting was never implemented. If you care to write it, please let me know!
